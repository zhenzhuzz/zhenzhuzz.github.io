<p class="intro-text"><strong>Facing global challenges such as energy exhaustion, climate change, and AI ethics, my education instills a profound sense of responsibility to act for the greater good. To fulfill this mission, I seek more than technical expertise by engaging in international discussions, deepening my understanding of humanity's most pressing issues, and exploring meaningful solutions.</strong></p>

    <p class="locdate"><em>Beijing, China</em><br>Apr, 2024</p>
    <p class="feeling-section">One discussion I found particularly engaging focused on AI ethics and data security, highlighting how AI is evolving faster than legal frameworks. Data is now a vital resource, akin to petroleum, raising questions about how law can balance data usage for AI-driven productivity with privacy protection. There was also debate around the geopolitical challenges of one country exploiting another's data, particularly between two AI superpowers, and how such conflicts could be addressed under evolving international law.</p>
