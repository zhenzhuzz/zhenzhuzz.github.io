Hi! I am a third-year Master's student at [**Tsinghua University (THU)**](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Mechanical Engineering, where I am fortunate to be advised by [**Dr. Feng Feng**](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ff_en/) and [**Prof. Pingfa Feng**](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1271/1991.htm). I have also had the opportunity to work with [**Prof. Eckart Uhlmann**](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/en/about-us/director.html) from [**Fraunhofer IPK**](https://www.ipk.fraunhofer.de/en.html) and [**Institute of Machine Tools and Factory Management (IWF), Technische Universit√§t Berlin (TUB)**](https://www.tu.berlin/en/iwf) on Sino-Germon Mobility Program.

Prior to Tsinghua, I graduated from [**Tianjin University (TJU)**](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/) in June 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am grateful to [**Prof Shuxin Wang**](https://me.tju.edu.cn/faculty_teachers.action?cla=5&teacherid=1460), [**Prof. Yanhui Wang**](https://me.tju.edu.cn/faculty_teachers.action?cla=5&teacherid=1768), and [**Prof. Fujun Wang**](https://me.tju.edu.cn/faculty_teachers.action?cla=5&teacherid=1778) for offering me research experience and opportunities to participate in their programs.

My research interests lie broadly in **Micro-Nano Fabrication and Measurement**, particularly for high-precision applications in semiconductors, photonics, and advanced materials, and I am seeking a PhD program in this field. I am also familiar with **Intelligent Manufacturing**, including Robotic Machining, Signal Processing, Dynamics and Mechanics -- check my [**publications**](publications) or [**CV (PDF)**](CV_ZhenZhu.pdf) for more information. I am open to relevant PhD opportunities, so feel free to reach out.
